I believe studying MBA has eliminated the Academic obstacles on my path to achieving my career goals. My short-term career goal is to work in Mechanical Design preferably in Aerospace industry; after gaining enough experience in the field, I'm planning to move up to leadership levels.

Not only am I fully in charge of the leather collection's visual merchandising, but working so closely with the Regional Visual Merchandising Coordinator has allowed me more than a year of thorough training while assisting her with the visual merchandising in every aspect in our location. I worked with her year-round on case-lines, window displays, vitrines, and together we did the visual merchandising for 2 major in-store events this year- one for my leather collection's Fall launch and also for the Super Bowl trophy presentation that gained national attention."], "overviewEducation": ["", "Martin"], "summarySpecialties": [], "location": [], "educationSchoolName1": "", "educationSchoolName3": [], "educationSchoolName2": "Martin", "eduTimeEnd1": "2008", "eduTimeEnd3": [], "eduTimeEnd2": "2004", "experienceHeads": [], "name": [], "url": "http://www.linkedin.com/in/laurynkirby", "eduTimeStart3": [], "industry": [], "eduTimeStart1": "2004", "headlineTitle": [], "eduTimeStart2": "2000", "overviewCurrent": ["", ""]},
